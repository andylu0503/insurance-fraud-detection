# 🛡️ Insurance Fraud Detection Project

This project focuses on identifying potential insurance fraud using customer and claim data. It applies machine learning classification models to predict whether a given insurance claim is likely to be fraudulent.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Policy and customer demographics
- Vehicle and property claim details
- Incident severity, location, and police report availability
- Target variable: `fraud_reported` (Y/N)

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC

## 🔍 Key Insights

- `incident_severity` is the top feature influencing fraud detection.
- `insured_hobbies` and claim amounts also impact fraud likelihood.
- ML models can improve early fraud detection significantly.
