README.md,"# 🛡️ Insurance Fraud Detection Project

This project focuses on identifying potential insurance fraud using customer and claim data. It applies machine learning classification models to predict whether a given insurance claim is likely to be fraudulent.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes information about:

- Policy and customer demographics
- Vehicle and property claim details
- Incident descriptions and severity
- Historical and behavioral variables

The target variable is `fraud_reported` (Y/N), which indicates whether the claim was flagged as fraud.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC
- Feature Importance Analysis

## 🔍 Key Insights

- `incident_severity` and `insured_hobbies` are the most important predictors of fraud.
- High-value claims and shorter customer tenure correlate with higher fraud probability.
- Machine learning can help automate early fraud detection and improve investigation efficiency.

## 📈 Model Results (Random Forest)

- Accuracy: ~XX% (adjust based on output)
- Precision / Recall / F1-score: See classification report in notebook
- Feature importance plot reveals key drivers of fraudulent behavior.

Resume Description,"Insurance Fraud Detection | Python, ML, EDA

Built a machine learning model using insurance customer and claims data to predict potential fraud cases. Used Random Forest Classifier to achieve accurate fraud classification, identifying key factors such as incident severity and insured hobbies. Performed feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation with precision and recall metrics.

Key tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Google Colab, Matplotlib"
LinkedIn Description,"🔍 **Insurance Fraud Detection Project**

I analyzed an insurance claims dataset to predict the likelihood of fraud using Python and machine learning. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building with Random Forest, I uncovered that variables such as incident severity and insured hobbies were strong predictors of fraudulent behavior.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in EDA, classification models, and feature importance interpretation.
